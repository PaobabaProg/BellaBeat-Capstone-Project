# Bellabeat Case Study: Smart Device Usage Analysis

This project was completed as part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone. It analyzes Fitbit fitness tracker data to explore how users' physical activity, sleep, and sedentary behavior can inform product recommendations for Bellabeat, a wellness-focused smart device company.

## Project Summary

- **Dataset**: Public Fitbit data from 33 users over 2 months  
- **Tools**: R, RStudio (Posit Cloud), Excel, SQL  
- **Focus**: Relationships between activity, sleep, and sedentary minutes  
- **Goal**: Generate insights and recommendations for Bellabeat's product strategy  

## Key Insights

- Users showed high sedentary time (often exceeding 800 minutes/day)  
- Weak correlation between steps and sedentary time  
- Moderate negative correlation between intense activity and sleep duration  
- Low participation in sleep tracking  

## Recommendations

1. Implement inactivity alerts in the app  
2. Improve and promote sleep tracking features  
3. Provide tips to balance activity with recovery  
4. Use user data to personalize wellness insights  

## Use of Generative AI

This project was developed with support from OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT, which served as a learning assistant throughout. It helped with R coding, debugging, concept explanations, and summarizing findings. I take full responsibility for the analysis and final output.
